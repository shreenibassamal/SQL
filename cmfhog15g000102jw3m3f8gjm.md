## üîπ 1. What is Agile?

* **Agile** is a **software development methodology** based on **iterative and incremental development**.
    
* Instead of delivering the whole project at the end, Agile delivers **small, working software pieces frequently** (every 1‚Äì4 weeks).
    
* Focus: **Customer collaboration, flexibility, continuous feedback, and quick delivery**.
    

---

## üîπ 2. Why Agile Came?

Before Agile, companies used **Waterfall model**:

* Long development cycle ‚Üí customer sees product only at the end.
    
* Requirements changed ‚Üí rework costly.
    
* Testing done at the end ‚Üí late bug detection.
    

üëâ Agile came to **solve these problems**:

* Early feedback
    
* Faster releases
    
* Adapting to requirement changes
    
* Continuous testing + integration
    

---

## üîπ 3. When Agile Came?

* Introduced in **2001** through the **Agile Manifesto** by 17 software experts.
    
* Document: Agile Manifesto
    

---

## üîπ 4. Agile Manifesto (4 Values)

1. **Individuals & interactions** over processes & tools
    
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
    
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
    
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

## üîπ 6. Agile Frameworks

Agile is a philosophy; it has many frameworks:

* **Scrum** (most common) ‚Üí Iterations = *Sprints*
