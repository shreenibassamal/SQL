### What is FrontEnd?

Frontend is something that is visible to the user.

**ex**: In a web application, you can see the web elements like inputArea, radioButton, All elements are visible to the user.

### What is BackEnding?

The backend is the code that is written by developers ,it could be data or database every thing is backend of an application and it is not visiable to user.

Ex:

### When coming to the testing

* In frontend manual testing is performed, with the help of frontend.
    
* In Backend API testing fall in to Action .
    
    **NOTE**: API is complete about backend.
    

### What is WebApplication?

Any application which is accessable through browser is called as web application.

In client-server applications if we go for web application a browser act as a client.

**server**: process the request and give back the response to client.

### What is Browser?

* A browser is a stand-alone application that is used to access any webapplication over the network via **URI**.
    
* The browser understand only HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and hence it always create **HTTP-request** and interpret **HTTP-response** the given by the webserver.
    
* The browser is the only way to access the web application.
    
* The browser always sends and receive the request via **HTTP** (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol).
    
    **EX**: Chrome, Brave , Firefox, Opera, Edge, etc.
    

### What is WebServer?

Web- server as name implies it ‚Äúserver the Request to to browser‚Äù , it help both web-server and web-application to intract with each other.

## üîπ **Web Server**

A **Web Server** is software (and sometimes hardware) that:

1. **Stores, processes, and delivers web content** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) to clients (browsers).
    
2. Handles **HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses**.
    
3. Serves **static content** and can forward **dynamic requests** to an Application Server.
    

---

### üîπ Functions of a Web Server

* Accepts HTTP requests from browsers (clients).
    
* Serves static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, videos).
    
* Can use plugins/CGI scripts to generate dynamic content.
    
* Routes API or servlet requests to **Application Server** if needed.
    

---

### üîπ Examples

* **Apache HTTP Server**
    
* **Nginx**
    
* **IIS (Internet Information Services)**
    
* **LiteSpeed**
    
* **Tomcat (acts as both Web + App server)**
    

---

### üîπ Web Server vs App Server (Quick Difference)

| Feature | **Web Server** | **Application Server** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Purpose** | Serves static content, handles HTTP requests | Runs business logic, processes dynamic content |
| **Content** | HTML, CSS, JS, images | Servlets, EJBs, APIs |
| **Examples** | Apache, Nginx, IIS | WebLogic, JBoss, Tomcat |

---

‚úÖ **In short:**  
A **Web Server** is software that **accepts client (browser) requests and serves static content** or forwards dynamic requests to an **Application Server** for processing.

### What is AppServer or WebApplication?

## üîπ **App Server (Application Server)**

* An **Application Server** is a software framework that provides an environment to run **business logic (server-side code)**.
    
* It handles **complex operations** like transactions, messaging, security, and database connectivity.
    
* Examples: **JBoss, WebSphere, WebLogic, GlassFish, Tomcat (partially)**.
    

üëâ Think of it as:  
‚Äú**Where your core business logic lives and runs.**‚Äù

---

## üîπ **Web Application**

* A **Web Application** is a **software program** that runs on a web server and can be accessed through a browser via the internet or intranet.
    
* It usually contains **frontend (UI)** + **backend logic** + **database**.
    
* Examples: **Facebook, Gmail, Online Banking, Amazon**.
    

üëâ Think of it as:  
‚Äú**An actual application users interact with via a browser.**‚Äù

---

## üîπ Key Difference

| Feature | **App Server** | **Web Application** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Definition** | Platform to run business logic | Actual software used by end-users |
| **Purpose** | Provides environment for backend code | Provides functionality to users |
| **Examples** | JBoss, WebLogic, Tomcat | Gmail, Amazon, Netflix |
| **User Access** | Developers/Programs interact | End-users interact via browser |

---

‚úÖ **In short:**

* **App Server** = The engine/environment that runs your backend code.
    
* **Web Application** = The actual app (with UI + backend) users access via a browser.
    

### Types of Web Resources?

### What is URL explain with syntax ?

* URL or WebURL is used to uniquely identify the specific web resources within the web application.
    
* Every web application should have its unique adress in the form of url.
    

URL is the only way to access web applications vai browser.

### Syntax of URL

### protocol :// domainName:portNumber/resourcePath?queyString#fragmentId

### What is protocol ?

* When one application wants to communicate with other application, there need to be a common language that both applications understand each other ,Hence we use protocol.
    
* The protocol is a common language where two applications exchange information with each other.
    
* It is a set of rule and instructions.
    
* The browser always sends a request and receives a response vai HHTP protocol hence it is called HHTP-request / HTTP-response,
    

Its optional information and case insensitive

### Some other types of protocol are

* HTTP
    
* HTTPS
    
* FTP
    
* SMTP
    

### What is domain name?

* Used to uniquely identify the the specific computer / service within the network in which web application present.
    
* A domain name might be a computer name ot IP-adress
    
* It is mandotory information
    
    Ex: www.amazon.com
    

### What is port number ?

* Used to uniquely identify the specific software/applicatiuon within the computer/system.
    
* It is optional information in the webURL.
    
* The below table specify the defect port number.
    

### What is Resources path?

* Used to uniqly identify the specific Web resources within the application server(webapplication).
    
* EX:
    

### What is Query String ?

* It is one of the parameter passed in the URL which i used to specify / filter a condition.
    
* Query String always begins with ‚Äù **? ‚Äú.**
    
* Query String is always written in **name = value** pairs\*\*.\*\*
    
* We can have any numbers of **name = value** pairs separated by ‚Äú **&** ‚Äú .
    

### What is fragmentID?

* Used to uniquely identify the specific fragment/ section within the webpage.
    
* FragmentID should always begain with ‚Äú **#** ‚Äú.
    
* **EX**: #inbox, #Draft etc in gmail.

### What is content type?

### What is cookies?

### What is form-data and raw-data?

### What is status code ?

### üîπ **Status Code (in API / HTTP)**

A **status code** is a **three-digit number** returned by a web server in the HTTP response to indicate the result of the client‚Äôs request.

It tells **whether the request was successful, failed, redirected, or encountered an error**.

---

### üîπ Status Code Categories

1. **1xx (Informational)** ‚Üí Request received, still processing.
    
    * Example: `100 Continue`
        
2. **2xx (Success)** ‚Üí Request successful.
    
    * Example: `200 OK`, `201 Created`
        
3. **3xx (Redirection)** ‚Üí Further action needed (redirect).
    
    * Example: `301 Moved Permanently`, `302 Found`
        
4. **4xx (Client Error)** ‚Üí Request has an error from client side.
    
    * Example: `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`, `404 Not Found`
        
5. **5xx (Server Error)** ‚Üí Server failed to process valid request.
    
    * Example: `500 Internal Server Error`, `503 Service Unavailable`
        

---

### üîπ Example in RestAssured

```java
given()
.when()
    .get("/users/2")
.then()
    .statusCode(200);   // Validating status code
```

---

‚úÖ In short:  
**A status code is the server‚Äôs way of telling the client what happened with the request.**

### What is response time?

### üîπ **Response Time (in API Testing)**

**Response Time** is the total time taken by the server to **process a request and send back the response** to the client.

It is usually measured in **milliseconds (ms)** or **seconds (s)**.

---

### üîπ Components of Response Time

1. **Network latency** ‚Üí Time taken for request to travel from client ‚Üí server.
    
2. **Server processing time** ‚Üí Time server takes to process the request (database queries, business logic, etc.).
    
3. **Response transfer time** ‚Üí Time taken for response to travel from server ‚Üí client.
    

---

### üîπ Why It Matters

* Helps measure **performance** of APIs.
    
* Ensures API meets **SLA (Service Level Agreement)** or business requirements.
    
* Identifies performance bottlenecks.
    

---

### üîπ Example in RestAssured

```java
long responseTime = 
    given()
    .when()
        .get("/users/2")
    .time();

System.out.println("Response Time: " + responseTime + " ms");
```

---

‚úÖ In short:  
**Response Time = Time taken from sending a request to receiving the full response.**

### What is actual data?

### üîπ **Actual Data (in Testing / API context)**

**Actual Data** is the **output or response returned by the system under test (SUT)** when a test case is executed.

It is what you **really get** from the application or API during execution.

---

### üîπ Example (API Testing)

* **Request:** `GET /users/1`
    
* **Expected Data (Expected Result):**
    

```java
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

* **Actual Data (Actual Result):**
    

```java
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

Here, the **Actual Data** is the real response the API gives.

---

### üîπ Why It‚Äôs Important

* Used to **compare with Expected Data**.
    
* If **Actual = Expected** ‚Üí Test **Pass**.
    
* If **Actual ‚â† Expected** ‚Üí Test **Fail** (defect found).
    

---

‚úÖ In short:  
**Actual Data = The real output returned by the application when a test is run.**

### What are the pre-request for API testing?

### üîπ **Pre-requisites for API Testing**

1. **Basic Knowledge of APIs**
    
    * Understand REST, SOAP, HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH).
        
    * Know about request/response structure (headers, body, params).
        
2. **API Documentation**
    
    * Have the API specification (Swagger, Postman collection, API contract).
        
    * Know available endpoints, request format, and response format.
        
3. **Access to API Environment**
    
    * Base URI (e.g., [`https://api.test.com`](https://api.test.com)).
        
    * Test/staging environment where API is deployed.
        
4. **Authentication & Authorization**
    
    * Valid credentials (API keys, tokens, OAuth, JWT, Basic Auth).
        
5. **Test Data**
    
    * Input data required for API requests (IDs, payloads, params).
        
    * Expected output data for validation.
        
6. **API Testing Tools**
    
    * Tools like Postman, RestAssured, JMeter, SoapUI, or CURL.
        
7. **Understanding of Status Codes**
    
    * Should know HTTP response codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 404, 500).
        
8. **Network/Environment Setup**
    
    * Internet/VPN access (if API is restricted).
        
    * Proxy/firewall permissions (if applicable).
        
9. **Database Access (Optional)**
    
    * To validate if API response is consistent with backend DB.
        

---

‚úÖ In short:  
**Before testing an API, you need documentation, environment details, authentication, test data, and tools to send/validate requests.**

### What are the limits of API usage?

### üîπ **Limits of API Usage**

API usage limits are **restrictions set by the provider** to control how clients (users or applications) access the API.

They prevent **abuse, server overload, and ensure fair usage**.

---

### üîπ Common Types of API Limits

1. **Rate Limits**
    
    * Maximum number of requests allowed in a specific time period.
        
    * Example: *1000 requests per hour*.
        
2. **Quota Limits**
    
    * Maximum number of requests allowed in a **day, week, or month**.
        
    * Example: *50,000 requests per month*.
        
3. **Payload Size Limit**
    
    * Restriction on the size of request/response body.
        
    * Example: *Max 5MB per request*.
        
4. **Concurrent Request Limit**
    
    * Maximum number of API calls allowed at the same time.
        
    * Example: *10 parallel requests*.
        
5. **Data Access Restrictions**
    
    * Limited fields/data can be fetched per call.
        
    * Example: *Only 100 records per API call*.
        
6. **Time-Out Limit**
    
    * APIs stop processing if the request takes too long.
        
    * Example: *30 seconds timeout*.
        
7. **Authentication/Token Limitations**
    
    * API tokens/keys may have limited validity or scope.
        
    * Example: *Token valid for 1 hour*.
        

---

### üîπ Why Limits Exist

* To **protect server resources**.
    
* To **ensure fair usage** among all clients.
    
* To **prevent abuse/misuse** like DoS attacks.
    

---

‚úÖ In short:  
**API usage limits define how many requests you can send, how much data you can exchange, and under what conditions, to keep APIs reliable and secure.**

### How does API works?

An API (Application Programming Interface) acts as a **middleman or an intermediary** that allows two different software applications to communicate with each other. Instead of building every piece of functionality from scratch, applications can leverage APIs to access features or data from other applications.

Think of it like this:

Imagine you're in a restaurant (your application), and you want to order food (get data or a service). You don't go into the kitchen and cook it yourself. Instead, you look at the menu (the API documentation), tell the waiter (the API) what you want, and the waiter takes your order to the kitchen (the server or another application). The kitchen then prepares the food (processes the request) and the waiter brings it back to you (the API sends the response).

Here's a breakdown of how an API generally works, focusing on the most common scenario: **Web APIs (like REST APIs) using HTTP**:

1. **Client Initiates a Request:**
    
    * A "client" (your web browser, a mobile app, another server, or even a command-line tool) needs information or wants to perform an action on a "server" (where the data or service resides).
        
    * The client constructs an **HTTP Request**. This request includes:
        
        * **Method:** What kind of action (e.g., `GET` to retrieve, `POST` to create, `PUT` to update, `DELETE` to remove).
            
        * **URL/Endpoint:** The specific address of the resource or service it wants to interact with (e.g., [`https://api.example.com/users/123`](https://api.example.com/users/123)).
            
        * **Headers:** Additional information about the request (e.g., `Authorization` for authentication, `Content-Type` for the data format being sent, `User-Agent` to identify the client).
            
        * **Body (optional):** Data being sent to the server (e.g., JSON data for creating a new user in a `POST` request).
            
2. **Request Sent Over the Internet:**
    
    * The client sends this HTTP request over the internet to the server hosting the API.
        
3. **Server Receives and Processes the Request:**
    
    * The server's API receives the incoming request.
        
    * It **parses** the request, looking at the method, URL, headers, and body.
        
    * It **authenticates and authorizes** the client (checks if the client is who they say they are and if they have permission to perform that action on that resource). If not, it sends an error.
        
    * It **validates** the request (e.g., Are all required parameters present? Is the data in the correct format?). If not, it sends an error.
        
    * If valid and authorized, the API then **executes the necessary logic**. This might involve:
        
        * Querying a database to retrieve data.
            
        * Saving new data to a database.
            
        * Performing calculations.
            
        * Interacting with other internal services.
            
4. **Server Sends an HTTP Response:**
    
    * Once the server has processed the request, it constructs an **HTTP Response** to send back to the client. This response includes:
        
        * **Status Code:** A numerical code indicating the outcome of the request (e.g., `200 OK` for success, `404 Not Found` if the resource doesn't exist, `500 Internal Server Error` if something went wrong on the server).
            
        * **Headers:** Additional information about the response (e.g., `Content-Type` of the data being sent back, `Date`).
            
        * **Body (optional):** The actual data requested by the client (e.g., a JSON object containing user details) or a message indicating the result of an action (e.g., "User created successfully").
            
5. **Client Receives and Processes the Response:**
    
    * The client receives the response.
        
    * It **interprets the status code** to understand if the request was successful or if an error occurred.
        
    * It **parses the response body** (if any) to extract the data or confirmation message.
        
    * It then uses this data to update its user interface, perform further actions, or display information to the user.
        

**Key principles that make APIs work efficiently:**

* **Standardization:** APIs often adhere to common standards (like HTTP, REST principles, JSON, XML) which makes them predictable and easier for different applications to understand and integrate with.
    
* **Contract:** The API acts as a contract between the client and the server. The API documentation defines what requests the server expects and what responses it will send back.
    
* **Abstraction:** APIs hide the complexity of the underlying system. The client doesn't need to know *how* the server stores data or performs its operations; it just needs to know *what* to ask for and *what* to expect back.
    
* **Statelessness (in REST):** Each request from a client to a server contains all the information needed to understand the request. The server doesn't store any client context between requests. This makes APIs more scalable.
    

In essence, APIs provide a structured and standardized way for software components to interact, enabling modularity, reusability, and the creation of complex applications by combining capabilities from various sources.

### What are the main type of API?

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) can be categorized in a few ways, but the most common classifications are based on their **access level (who can use them)** and their **architectural style/protocol (how they work)**.

Here are the main types:

---

### By Access Level (Audience)

This classification focuses on the intended users of the API and the level of access granted.

1. **Public APIs (Open APIs / External APIs):**
    
    * **Description:** These APIs are available for anyone to use, often with little to no restriction. They are designed to be easily consumable by external developers and the general public, encouraging innovation and integrations. While many are free, some may have usage limits or require registration and an API key.
        
    * **Examples:** Google Maps API, Twitter API, OpenWeatherMap API.
        
    * **Use Case:** Allowing third-party developers to build applications that leverage a company's data or services.
        
2. **Partner APIs:**
    
    * **Description:** These APIs are shared externally, but only with specific, authorized business partners. Access is usually governed by a formal agreement or contract, and they often involve stricter security and access controls than public APIs.
        
    * **Examples:** An e-commerce platform's API for shipping companies, a payment gateway API used by online stores (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
        
    * **Use Case:** Facilitating secure and controlled communication and data exchange between collaborating businesses.
        
3. **Private APIs (Internal APIs):**
    
    * **Description:** These APIs are developed and used exclusively within an organization. They are not exposed to external users or third parties. Their primary purpose is to connect different internal systems, services, or teams, streamline internal processes, and enhance productivity.
        
    * **Examples:** An API connecting a company's CRM system to its accounting software, an API for managing employee data within an HR system.
        
    * **Use Case:** Enabling integration between various components of a company's own IT infrastructure, often supporting microservices architectures.
        
4. **Composite APIs:**
    
    * **Description:** These APIs combine multiple data or service APIs into a single, unified interface. They allow developers to make a single request to receive data or perform actions that would otherwise require multiple individual API calls.
        
    * **Examples:** A dashboard API that pulls user profile, order history, and payment information from three different internal services in one go.
        
    * **Use Case:** Simplifying complex interactions, reducing network calls, and improving performance for applications that need data from various sources.
        

---

### By Architectural Style/Protocol (How they work)

This classification relates to the underlying technology and communication patterns.

1. **REST APIs (Representational State Transfer):**
    
    * **Description:** The most popular and widely used type of web API. REST is an architectural style that leverages standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) to interact with resources identified by URLs. They are stateless, flexible, and typically use JSON or XML for data exchange.
        
    * **Why popular:** Simplicity, scalability, and compatibility with web standards.
        
    * **Use Case:** Building modern web and mobile applications, microservices, and general data exchange over the internet.
        
2. **SOAP APIs (Simple Object Access Protocol):**
    
    * **Description:** A protocol that uses XML to structure messages for web services. SOAP is more rigid, standardized, and often requires a WSDL (Web Services Description Language) file. It supports various transport protocols (HTTP, SMTP, TCP).
        
    * **Why used:** Known for strong security features (WS-Security), ACID compliance, and formal contracts, often favored in enterprise-level applications, finance, and healthcare.
        
    * **Use Case:** Enterprise systems, legacy integrations, applications requiring high security and transactional integrity.
        
3. **GraphQL APIs:**
    
    * **Description:** A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need from the server, avoiding over-fetching or under-fetching of data. It operates over a single endpoint and is highly efficient.
        
    * **Why popular:** Offers flexibility and efficiency in data retrieval, especially for complex applications with varying data needs.
        
    * **Use Case:** Mobile applications, single-page applications, and scenarios where clients need highly specific data.
        
4. **RPC APIs (Remote Procedure Call):**
    
    * **Description:** This type of API allows a program to execute a procedure (function or subroutine) in a different address space (typically on a remote server) as if it were a local procedure. Variations include XML-RPC (using XML) and JSON-RPC (using JSON).
        
    * **Why used:** Simple for calling specific functions directly.
        
    * **Use Case:** Scenarios where direct function invocation is preferred over resource manipulation, often in older systems or specialized microservices (like gRPC, which is a modern high-performance RPC framework using Protocol Buffers and HTTP/2).
        

Understanding these different types of APIs helps in designing, developing, and testing software effectively, as each type has its own strengths, weaknesses, and appropriate use cases.

### What are some common protocol used in API testing ?

API testing involves interacting with Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to ensure they are functioning correctly, securely, and efficiently. Several common protocols are used for this, each with its characteristics and use cases:

1. **REST (Representational State Transfer):**
    
    * **Description:** REST is an architectural style, not a strict protocol, that uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) to perform operations on resources identified by URLs (endpoints). It's stateless, meaning each request from the client to the server contains all the information needed to understand the request.
        
    * **Data Formats:** Primarily uses JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), but can also use XML, HTML, or plain text.
        
    * **Why it's common in testing:** Its simplicity, widespread adoption, and reliance on standard HTTP make it very easy to test using tools like Postman, SoapUI, or even cURL. Testers can easily simulate requests and validate responses.
        
    * **Testing Focus:** Verifying HTTP methods, status codes, response payloads (data, format), error handling, and resource manipulation.
        
2. **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):**
    
    * **Description:** SOAP is a protocol that uses XML to define the structure of messages for exchanging structured information in web services. It's more rigid and standardized than REST, often requiring a Web Services Description Language (WSDL) file to describe the service.
        
    * **Data Formats:** Primarily XML.
        
    * **Why it's common in testing:** Despite its complexity, SOAP is still widely used in enterprise environments, especially for legacy systems and applications requiring strict security and transactional integrity. Testing tools like SoapUI are specifically designed for SOAP APIs.
        
    * **Testing Focus:** Validating XML request and response structures, ensuring operations defined in WSDL work as expected, handling security (WS-Security), and testing complex workflows.
        
3. **GraphQL:**
    
    * **Description:** GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. Developed by Facebook, it allows clients to request exactly the data they need, no more and no less, by defining a schema.
        
    * **Data Formats:** Primarily JSON for queries and responses.
        
    * **Why it's common in testing:** Its flexibility and efficiency in data fetching make it popular for modern applications. Testing involves crafting specific queries and mutations (for data modification) and verifying the precise data received.
        
    * **Testing Focus:** Validating query syntax, ensuring accurate data retrieval based on specific fields requested, testing mutations, and checking for proper error handling when queries are malformed or unauthorized.
        
4. **RPC (Remote Procedure Call):**
    
    * **Description:** RPC is a protocol that allows a program on one computer to cause a procedure or function to execute on a different computer without the programmer explicitly coding the remote interaction. It's more about calling functions directly rather than manipulating resources.
        
    * **Variations:** Includes XML-RPC (uses XML over HTTP) and JSON-RPC (uses JSON over HTTP).
        
    * **Why it's common in testing:** While less common for general-purpose web APIs than REST, it's used in specific scenarios where direct function calls are more appropriate.
        
    * **Testing Focus:** Verifying that specific remote procedures are executed correctly and that the returned results are as expected.
        
5. **gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call):**
    
    * **Description:** A modern, high-performance RPC framework developed by Google. It uses Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) for efficient serialization of structured data and HTTP/2 for transport, enabling faster communication and advanced features like streaming.
        
    * **Data Formats:** Protocol Buffers.
        
    * **Why it's common in testing:** Increasingly used in microservices architectures due to its performance benefits. Testing gRPC APIs often requires specialized tools and libraries that can handle Protobuf and HTTP/2.
        
    * **Testing Focus:** Validating service methods, data serialization/deserialization, streaming behaviors (client-side, server-side, bidirectional), and error handling.
        

**Key considerations in API testing regardless of protocol:**

* **Functional Testing:** Verifying that the API performs its intended functions correctly.
    
* **Performance Testing:** Assessing the API's speed, responsiveness, and stability under various loads (e.g., load testing, stress testing).
    
* **Security Testing:** Checking for vulnerabilities like authentication and authorization flaws, injection attacks, and data exposure.
    
* **Reliability Testing:** Ensuring consistent behavior and error handling under different conditions.
    
* **Validation:** Checking response status codes, data types, and the structure of the response body.
    
* **Error Handling:** Testing how the API responds to invalid inputs, missing parameters, or server-side issues.
    

The choice of protocol for API testing heavily depends on the API itself, as testers must use tools and methods compatible with the API's chosen communication standard.

### What are the components of an HTTP request?

An HTTP request is a message sent by a client (like your web browser) to a server to request a resource. It's made up of several key components:

1. **Request Line:** This is the first line of the HTTP request and contains three parts:
    
    * **Method:** This indicates the action the client wants to perform on the resource. Common methods include:
        
        * `GET`: Retrieves data from the server.
            
        * `POST`: Submits data to be processed to a specified resource.
            
        * `PUT`: Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
            
        * `DELETE`: Deletes the specified resource.
            
        * `HEAD`: Retrieves the headers only, without the body.
            
        * `OPTIONS`: Describes the communication options for the target resource.
            
    * Path (or Request-URI): This specifies the particular resource the client is requesting on the server. For example, /index.html or /api/users.
        
    * **HTTP Version:** This indicates the version of the HTTP protocol the client is using (e.g., `HTTP/1.1`, `HTTP/2.0`).
        
2. **Headers (or Request Headers):** These are lines following the request line that provide additional information about the request, the client, or the body of the request. They are in the format `Header-Name: Header-Value`. Some common headers include:
    
    * `Host`: Specifies the domain name of the server (required for HTTP/1.1).
        
    * `User-Agent`: Identifies the client software making the request (e.g., browser type and version).
        
    * `Accept`: Indicates the media types (e.g., `text/html`, `application/json`) that the client is willing to accept in the response.
        
    * `Accept-Language`: Specifies the preferred human language for the response.
        
    * `Accept-Encoding`: Specifies the encoding methods the client understands (e.g., `gzip`, `deflate`).
        
    * `Content-Type`: Indicates the media type of the request body (important for `POST` and `PUT` requests).
        
    * `Content-Length`: The length of the request body in bytes.
        
    * `Cookie`: Contains HTTP cookies previously sent by the server.
        
    * `Authorization`: Contains credentials for authenticating a user agent with a server.
        
3. **Blank Line:** A blank line (CRLF - carriage return, line feed) separates the headers from the message body. This is crucial for the server to understand where the headers end and the body begins.
    
4. **Message Body (or Request Body):** This is an optional part of the request, used to send data to the server, primarily with `POST` and `PUT` methods. For example, when submitting a form, the form data would be in the request body. The format of the body is specified by the `Content-Type` header.
    

In summary, an HTTP request looks something like this:

```java
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/126.0.0.0 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9

(Optional request body would go here)
```

### What does HTTP methods do?

HTTP methods (also known as HTTP verbs) define the type of action a client wants to perform on a resource identified by a URL. They are a core part of how RESTful APIs are designed and interact with resources. Here are the most common ones and their primary functions:

* `GET`:
    
    * **Purpose:** Retrieves data from the server.
        
    * **Characteristics:** Idempotent (multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single one) and safe (doesn't change server state).
        
    * **Usage:** Fetching a webpage, getting a list of users, retrieving details of a specific product.
        
    * **Body:** Typically no request body.
        
* `POST`:
    
    * **Purpose:** Sends data to the server to create a new resource or submit data for processing.
        
    * **Characteristics:** Not idempotent (multiple identical requests can create multiple resources) and not safe.
        
    * **Usage:** Submitting a form, creating a new user account, uploading a file.
        
    * **Body:** Contains the data to be sent (e.g., JSON, form-data).
        
* `PUT`:
    
    * **Purpose:** Updates an existing resource *or* creates a new resource if it doesn't exist at the specified URL. It replaces the *entire* resource with the new data.
        
    * **Characteristics:** Idempotent (putting the same resource multiple times has the same final state).
        
    * **Usage:** Fully updating a user's profile, replacing a document.
        
    * **Body:** Contains the complete new representation of the resource.
        
* `PATCH`:
    
    * **Purpose:** Applies *partial* modifications to an existing resource. It only sends the data that needs to be changed.
        
    * **Characteristics:** Not necessarily idempotent (depends on the specific implementation, but often designed to be).
        
    * **Usage:** Updating only a user's email address, incrementing a counter.
        
    * **Body:** Contains only the fields to be modified.
        
* `DELETE`:
    
    * **Purpose:** Removes a specified resource from the server.
        
    * **Characteristics:** Idempotent (deleting a resource multiple times has the same effect as a single one: the resource is gone).
        
    * **Usage:** Deleting a user, removing a product from a database.
        
    * **Body:** Typically no request body.
        
* `HEAD`:
    
    * **Purpose:** Similar to GET, but requests only the headers of the response, not the body.
        
    * **Characteristics:** Idempotent and safe.
        
    * **Usage:** Checking if a resource exists, verifying a file's size or modification date without downloading the entire content.
        
* `OPTIONS`:
    
    * **Purpose:** Describes the communication options for the target resource. It can be used to query the server about the HTTP methods supported by an endpoint.
        
    * **Characteristics:** Idempotent and safe.
        
    * **Usage:** Used in CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) preflight requests to check if an actual request is safe to send.
