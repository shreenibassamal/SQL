TypeScript is typed JavaScript. TypeScript adds types to JavaScript to help you speed up the development by catching errors before you even run the JavaScript code.

TypeScript is an open-source programming language that builds on top of JavaScript. It works on any web browser, any OS, and any environment that JavaScript runs.
