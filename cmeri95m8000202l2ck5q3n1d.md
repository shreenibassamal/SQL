### **What is Python programming language?**

Python is a **high-level, general-purpose, interpreted** programming language.

### **1) High-level**

Python is a high-level programming language that is easy to learn. It doesnâ€™t require you to understand the details of the computer to develop programs efficiently.

### **2) General-purpose**

Python is a general-purpose language. It means that you can use Python in various domains, including:

* Web applications
    
* Big data applications
    
* Testing
    
* Automation
    
* Data science, machine learning, and AI
    
* Desktop software
    
* Mobile apps
    

### **3) Interpreted**

Python is an interpreted language. To develop a Python program, you write Python code into a file called source code.

To execute the source code, you must convert it to a machine language the computer can understand. The Python **interpreter** turns the source code, line by line, once at a time, into the machine code when the Python program executes.

Compiled languages like Java and C# use a **compiler** that compiles the whole source code before the program executes.
