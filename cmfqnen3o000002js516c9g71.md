Jenkins is all about **configuration** because it needs to control jobs, environment, tools, plugins, and pipelines. Letâ€™s break it down step by step.

---

# ðŸ“Œ **Types of Configuration in Jenkins**

Jenkins has multiple layers of configuration:

---

## **1\. Global Configuration (Manage Jenkins â†’ Configure System)**

* Applies to the **entire Jenkins server**.
    
* Things you configure here:
    
    * JDK, Maven, Gradle installations
        
    * Git, SVN credentials
        
    * Email notifications (SMTP)
        
    * Environment variables
        
    * Plugins (e.g., Slack, SonarQube, Docker)
        
* Example: Set up Maven so all jobs can use it.
    

---

## **2\. Job/Project Configuration**

* Specific to each **job** (Freestyle, Maven, Pipeline, Multibranch).
    
* Configurable items:
    
    * Source Code Management (Git, SVN)
        
    * Build triggers (Poll SCM, Webhooks, Schedule with CRON)
        
    * Build steps (Run Maven goals, Execute shell/Windows batch)
        
    * Post-build actions (Email, Deploy, Archive artifacts, Publish reports)
        

---

## **3\. Node/Agent Configuration (Distributed Builds)**

* Jenkins can run builds on **multiple nodes (agents/slaves)**.
    
* Configuration includes:
    
    * Labels (e.g., "Windows", "Linux", "Docker")
        
    * Remote root directory
        
    * Launch method (SSH, JNLP, Docker, Cloud)
        
* Helps distribute workload (e.g., run Selenium tests on multiple OS).
    

---

## **4\. Plugin Configuration**

* Every plugin has its own config.
    
* Examples:
    
    * **Allure plugin** â†’ Reporting setup
        
    * **Slack plugin** â†’ Webhook URL for notifications
        
    * **GitHub plugin** â†’ Token & repo details
        

---

## **5\. Pipeline Configuration**

* In scripted or declarative pipelines (`Jenkinsfile`).
    
* Configurations include:
    
    * Stages (Build â†’ Test â†’ Deploy)
        
    * Agent selection (`agent any` or `agent { label 'linux' }`)
        
    * Tools (`maven`, `jdk`, `nodejs`)
        
    * Environment variables (`env.BROWSER = "chrome"`)
        

---

## **6\. Security & User Configuration**

* Manage Jenkins â†’ Configure Global Security.
    
* Options:
    
    * Authentication (LDAP, AD, GitHub, SSO)
        
    * Authorization (Matrix-based, Role-based strategy)
        
    * Credentials (username/password, SSH keys, API tokens)
        

---

## **7\. Build Environment Configuration**

* Inside job settings.
    
* Example:
    
    * Delete workspace before build
        
    * Inject environment variables
        
    * Use secret credentials in builds

# ðŸ“Œ **Summary Table**

| Configuration Type | Scope | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Global | Entire Jenkins | JDK, Maven, SMTP, Plugins |
| Job/Project | Single Job | SCM, Triggers, Build Steps |
| Node/Agent | Worker Machine | Labels, Launch method |
| Plugin | Plugin-specific | Slack, GitHub, SonarQube |
| Pipeline | Jenkinsfile | Stages, Agents, Env vars |
| Security | Access Control | Users, Roles, Credentials |
| Build Environment | Inside Job | Env vars, Cleanup, Secrets |

âœ… **In short:**

* **Global config** â†’ applies to whole Jenkins
    
* **Job config** â†’ applies only to a specific job
    
* **Node config** â†’ applies to build agents
    
* **Pipeline config** â†’ written in `Jenkinsfile`
    
* **Plugin & Security config** â†’ extend functionality
