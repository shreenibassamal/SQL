# **What is JavaScript**

JavaScript is a programming language initially designed to interact with elements of web pages. Within web browsers, JavaScript consists of three main parts:

* ECMAScript provides the core functionality.
    
* The [Document Object Model (DOM)](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-dom/) provides interfaces for interacting with elements on web pages
    
* The [Browser Object Model (BOM)](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-bom/) provides the browser API for interacting with the web browser.
